### Linear Equations
- [ ] Recognise $y=mx+c$ as the slope-intercept form
- [ ] Use $m=\frac{y_2 -y_1}{x_2 -x_1}$ to find linear gradients
- [ ] Parallel lines have the same gradient
- [ ] Perpendicular lines have negative reciprocal gradients ($m_1\cdot m_2=-1$)
### Quadratic Equations
- [ ] Recognise features (parabolic nature, turning point, axis of symmetry, intercepts)

- [ ] Understand the role of the discriminant $\Delta=b^2 -4ac$
- [ ]Â Find the equation of a quadratic given sufficient information
- [ ] Understand that solving $f(x)=k$ corresponds to the points where $y=f(x)$ cuts $y=k$
