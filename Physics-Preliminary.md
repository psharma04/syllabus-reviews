## Waves and Thermodynamics
### What is a wave?
> __Definition:__ A wave is a *__disturbance in a field__*, which results in a *__gross__ transfer of energy*

- There are 2 main types of waves: Mechanical and Electromagnetic
> Module 3 primarily focuses on mechanical waves, while Module 4 explores electromagnetic waves in more detail
- 

### Mechanical Waves
- A mechanical wave is a wave which requires a medium to propagate (move)
> Mechanical waves transfer energy from one place to another via a medium
